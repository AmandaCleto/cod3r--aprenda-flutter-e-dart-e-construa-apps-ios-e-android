## 🎇 Apprenticeship:

In this project my main learn was in how to integrate FIREBASE in flutter;
I also learned how to display real-time notifications for the users, allowing a background and foreground notification; Moreover, Along with the course I did some features as: register, sign in and image upload if the user wants it, if nots, so the app will provide a default image (flutter_boring_avatars) based on its name.

note: the source of firebase integration is available to consultation. The real project in firebase is already deleted.
